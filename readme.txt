The Min-Max Quantity Plugin for woocommerce allows you to set minimum and maximum order quantities globally for products depending on user roles.

== Description ==

Min/Max Quantity Plugin allows you to set minimum and maximum order quantities for products to different user roles. Example: you want to limit the possible order quantity for normal users on your products to 10 and want to set a minimum order quantity of 20 for wholesale users on the same products.
Currently the plugin sets the minimum and maximum order quantities global, to all the products. If there is no rule for a role, the plugin uses these fallback values: min = 1; max = 9 
You find the setup in your WordPress admin panel -> WooCommerce -> Min-Max Rules
